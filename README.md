## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

There are two main ways to use this application:

1.  **Via the Live Demo (Recommended):**
    Simply click on the [Live Demo link](https://abhinavrajdevx.github.io/binance-ohlc-charting-with-single-page-html/) above to open it directly in your browser.

2.  **Running Locally:**
    *   Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/abhinavrajdevx/binance-ohlc-charting-with-single-page-html.git
        ```
    *   Navigate to the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd binance-ohlc-charting-with-single-page-html
        ```
    *   Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. No web server is strictly necessary for this single-file application.

Once loaded:
1.  Select your desired **Trading Pair** from the dropdown.
2.  Choose your preferred **Timeframe**.
3.  Click the **"Fetch & Draw Chart"** button.
4.  Toggle the **Light/Dark mode** switch in the header to change themes.
5.  Interact with the chart (zoom, pan, hover for details).

## üîß Code Highlights

*   **`fetchCandlestickData(symbol, interval)`:** Asynchronously fetches kline data from the Binance API. It handles pagination (Binance API limit per request) by making multiple requests if needed to gather the full 7 days of data for the selected timeframe.
*   **`transformDataForChart(klines)`:** Processes the raw API response into the format required by ApexCharts.
*   **`renderChart(seriesData, symbol, interval)`:** Initializes and renders the ApexCharts candlestick chart with appropriate configurations, including theme settings.
*   **Theme Management:** JavaScript functions `applyTheme` and `toggleTheme` handle switching between light and dark modes, updating CSS variables and ApexCharts options accordingly. Theme preference is saved in `localStorage`.

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

*   Allow users to specify a custom date range.
*   Add more technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).
*   Implement drawing tools on the chart.
*   Allow users to save their favorite pairs/timeframes.
*   Auto-refresh chart data.
*   More comprehensive error handling and user feedback.
*   Option to download chart data or image.
